## Proposition of Internship

The development of systemic solutions for plastic wastes is a major societal challenge in medium/long terms.
The INEDIT ProjectThe Green Fablab project is based on our recent article of Distributed Recycling via additive Manufacturing (DRAM) approach
The context of this internship project is placed in the **Quality (I)** phase.

[See our paper in this link](/green-fablab/review-recycling/)


The development of cutting-edges technologies such as IoT and additive manufacturing can converge to propose options to create local closed loops for DRAM.

## Industrial Ecology

One of the focus for the reduction of plastic waste sink is the identification of potential source easealy to collect and treat on innovations laboratoires/spaces as fablabs, hacker/maker spaces.
In the same way, to create a symbiosis network needs competences in determination of the actor involved, the


## Goal

The main goal of the project is **to create a local network for distributed recycling**.
Moreover, to establish the organizational analysis to assure this experimentation.


### Specific goals


- To deploy an open source collector in the LF2L neighborhood to collect plastic
- Creation of social analysis of based on industrial ecology and territorial development approach.
- Création et preuve de concept d’un démonstrateur de recyclage aux rives de Meurthe
- Enquêtes sur l’acceptabilité sociale pour les initiatives des recyclages (à valider avec la partie recherche du projet)


### Results

- Cartography of stakeholders for a closed loop network
- Documentation via interviews, vidéo on the deployment of the experimentation for each actor:
  + Public institution: ENSGSI (GSI Media + Recycling challengue)
  + Private: ATP Rives de Meurthe
  + Citizen: Foire Internationale de Nancy
