## Proposition of Internship

<img width="40%" class="align-left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LF2L/ERPI/master/assets/images/projects/inedit/teaser.png">
The [INEDIT (open INnovation Ecosystems for Do It Together process)](http://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/projects/INEDIT/) is a research project obtained in the framework of the European Union's H2020 programme starting in autumn 2019 for a duration of 36 months.

INEDIT creates an open innovation European DIT ecosystem for sustainable furniture co-creation.
It channels the creativity of consumers, shapes it through designers’ professional skills, and makes it viable by leveraging on the expertise of production specialists in order to deliver sustainable, smart and personalized new products in a shorter time to market.
INEDIT intends to demonstrate the capacity to turn the well-known ‘Do It Yourself’ (DIY) approach applied by individuals within FabLabs into a professional approach named ‘Do It Together’ (DIT).

Therefore, to create sustainable furniture, we developed a Distributed Recycling via additive Manufacturing (DRAM) approach:

[See our paper in this link](/green-fablab/review-recycling/)

Thus, the context of this internship project is placed in the **Recovery (I)** phase.  
The development of local closed loops for DRAM is a major goal for sustainable furniture co-creation  integring a DIT approach as driver.

## Industrial Ecology

One of the focus for the reduction of plastic waste sink is the identification of potential source easily to collect and treat on innovations laboratoires/spaces as fablabs, hacker/maker spaces.
In the same way, to create a symbiosis network is needed identifying the competences, barriers and opportunities of the actors involved.

## Goal

The main goal of the project is **to create a local network for distributed recycling** using a smart collector open hardware as driver. Moreover, to establish the organizational analysis to assure this experimentation.

### Specific goals

- To deploy an open source collector in the LF2L neighborhood to collect plastic
- Creation of social analysis of based on industrial ecology and territorial development approach.
- Création et preuve de concept d’un démonstrateur de recyclage aux rives de Meurthe
- Enquêtes sur l’acceptabilité sociale pour les initiatives des recyclages (à valider avec la partie recherche du projet)


### Results

- Cartography of stakeholders for a closed loop network
- Documentation via interviews, vidéo on the deployment of the experimentation for each actor:
  + Public institution: ENSGSI (GSI Media + Recycling challengue)
  + Private: ATP Rives de Meurthe
  + Citizen: Foire Internationale de Nancy
