# Internship: Quality in Fused Granular Deposition for distributed recycling
## Context

Since few years ago, the ERPI laboratory developeda research platform on innovation processes called the [Lorraine Fab Living Lab  (LF2L)](http://lf2l.fr/)^[More details: http://lf2l.fr/] to the development of projects  in a living lab approach taking into account the  *User Centered Design* principles.
The main goal is to develop research for prospective assessment of innovative usages
<!-- The LF2L physical environment is constituted by a *Collaborative* and a *FabLab* spaces. -->
<!-- The collaborative space allows users to foster co-operation in engineering design with different stakeholders in order to new create concepts/designs. -->
<!-- On the other hand, FabLab space allows users to materialize the concepts/designs  in an easy and quick way in order to have an prospective evaluation. -->

The [INEDIT (open INnovation Ecosystems for Do It Together process)](http://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/projects/INEDIT/) is a research project obtained in the framework of the European Union's H2020 program starting in autumn 2019 for a duration of 36 months develped at the LF2L.

INEDIT project seeks to create an open innovation European DIT ecosystem for sustainable furniture co-creation.
The main idea is to to deliver sustainable, smart and personalized new products in a shorter time to market through the creativity of consumers, shaping it through designers’ professional skills, and makes it viable by leveraging on the expertise of production specialists.

INEDIT intends to demonstrate the capacity to turn the well-known **‘Do-It-Yourself’ (DIY)** approach applied by individuals within FabLabs into a professional approach named **‘Do-It-Together’ (DIT)**.


## Distributed recycling via Additive Manufacturing

Circular economy is a major societal challenge in order to increase the recycling loop of plastic materials.  Therefore, the FabLab concept goes towards a better use of the resources present in these spaces.
Thus, one of the main output for INEDIT project is to evaluate the technical viability of Distributed Recycling via additive Manufacturing (DRAM) approach, based on our recent article as illustrated in the figure 1.
The global ambition is to develop a Green Fablab initiative (http://lf2l.fr/green-fablab/) to
create sustainable furniture.

The use of filament in the 3D printer is the establish method to the material deposition in the additive manufacturing context.
Nevertheless, the fabrication of filament is one step time-consuming and it does not add value to the printed object using a mono-material.
Indeed, The use of filament feedstock increases costs and narrows the variety of materials that can be used.

**The context of this internship project is placed at the *Feedstock (IV)*, Printing (V) and  Quality (VI) phases.**
Recently, a technology called Fused granular fabrication (FGF) is becoming very interesting given the fact of the adaptation of open-source (OS) 3D printers with domestic waste plastic extruders. This approach have been explored as a new prospective to polymer recycling in order to print object directly from recycled pellet as feedstock material.

@Arthur2020[^1] to evaluate the performance of the Fused Filament Fabrication and FGF techniques in terms of technical and economical dimensions at the desktop 3D printing scale. Recycled and virgin polylactic acid material was studied by using five different types of recycling feedstocks: commercial filament, pellets, distributed filament, distributed pellets, and shredded waste.

The major interest of this approach is the reduction of cost and greenhouse gas emissions related to waste collection and transportation as well as the environmental impact of manufacturing custom plastic parts.
This distributed polymer recycling approach could be an additional alternative to the conventional centralized polymer recycling [@Baechler2013[^2]; @Santander2020[^3]].

Taking into account the significant growing adoption of open-source (OS) 3D printing, distributed polymer recycling approach could be highly relevant as current recycling rates are particularly low.

However, one key point is missing. *How can we evaluate the 'robustness' of the FGF process to treat  plastic waste material including PLA, ABS, HDPE via DRAM approach'?*.
This is a major technical aspect in order to understand the characteristics of the recycled materials.


## Goal

The main goal of the project is **to evaluate the printing quality and reproducibility of a Fused Granular Fabrication machine designed as  an open hardware to test the reliability to print recycled assets collected at LF2L conditions**.

<!-- The development of 3D printers using direct extrusion systems to print can be one research axis for the development of the 3D printing process using recycled materials.  -->
<!-- This aspect could  further improve the adoption of the additive manufacturing technology. -->
<!-- However, the lack of a precise volumetric control of the extrusion is a limiting factor for the shape/form of the printed objects.  -->
<!-- Without the use of filament retraction feature, the creation of simple models is only possible after some manual tuning of rotation speed according to the current temperature and viscosity of the melted pellets. -->


### Specific goals

The main specific goals of this internship are:

- Realization of first trials test using virgin material (e.g. PLA) for calibration purposes and calibration test with regard to the commercial machines
- Evaluate the limits conditions of the open hardware machine using Design of Experiments (DoE) approach
- Fabrication of printing samples to validate the quality  considering the INEDIT project conditions
- Documentation of the test as scientific article defining the protocol, the user experience and the implications for DRAM.


### Expected elements to the end of the project

The following elements are expected as results:

- Benchmarking of the available literature  on the FGF process considering.
- Design a benchmarking model to evaluate the printability for FGF.
- Development of technical rapport considering the experimentation protocol.
- An on-line platform (e.g. a wiki, html page) for a complete documentation
- Test results of the evaluation
